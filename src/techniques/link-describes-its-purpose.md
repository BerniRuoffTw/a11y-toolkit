## Guidelines for links

- Don't include the word "link" inside a link. Most screen readers say "link" before each link. For example, a "products" link would be read as "link products" by JAWS.
- Avoid "click here," "more," "click for details," and similar ambiguous phrases. Links should make sense out of context.
- Place the distinguishing information of links at the beginning of a link. Secondary information can follow. e.g. `Products (opens in a new window)`
