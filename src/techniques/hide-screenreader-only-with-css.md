The `.sr-only` class is a utility class aiming at visually hiding the element while keeping it accessible to assistive technologies such as screen-readers. It relies on a carefully designed combination of declarations for maximum support, and `!important` bangs to make sure to override any more specific CSS.

```css
.sr-only {
	border: 0 !important;
	clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px) !important;
	-webkit-clip-path: inset(50%) !important;
	clip-path: inset(50%) !important;
	height: 1px !important;
	overflow: hidden !important;
	margin: -1px !important;
	padding: 0 !important;
	position: absolute !important;
	width: 1px !important;
	white-space: nowrap !important;
}
```

> **Important:** This technique should only be used to mask text. In other words, there shouldnâ€™t be any focusable element inside the hidden element. This could lead to annoying behaviours, like scrolling to an invisible element.
