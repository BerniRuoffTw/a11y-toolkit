Buttons are for clicking. By ensuring that they are big enough, you make sure that your users can click them with ease, even if they sit in a bumpy train or they have shaky hands. 44px is about the size of a standard thumb tip, so it also work for touch interfaces.

Here is one example how you could ensure a clickable area of min. 44x44px:

```css
…
font-size: 16px;
line-height: 20px;
padding: 12px 24px;
…
```
