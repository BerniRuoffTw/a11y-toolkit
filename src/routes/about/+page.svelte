<h1>What's the A11y toolkit?</h1>
<p>
	Since 2019 the organisation WebAIM (Web Accessibility In Mind) cunducts an yearly accessibility
	evaluation of the home pages for the top 1,000,000 web sites.
</p>
<p>
	Their <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/" target="_blank">WebAim Million study</a> has shown
	that 95.9% of home pages in 2024 had accessibility failures. Most of those failures are really simple
	to fix and to prevent.
</p>
<h2>We want to fix this</h2>
<p>
	The A11y toolkit shows you techniques and best practices how to avoid the most common
	accessibility failures.
</p>
<h2>You want to contribute?</h2>
